/*
Operator are the symbols that are used to perform the operation on the variables and manipulate the data.

-> 1.Arithmetic Operators - addition + ,Subtraction - ,multiplication * ,division / ,modulus %, exponential **
                            in js , console.log(4**3) it will give 65  i.e  4*4*4=64 i.e exponential operator

   2.Logical Operators -    logical AND && , logical OR || , logical NOT !
   3.Bitwise Operators -    bitwise AND &, bitwise OR |, bitwise NOT ~, bitwise XOR ^
   4.Comparison Operators - equal to == , not equal to != , less than < ,greater than >, less than equal to <=,
                            greater than equal to >=, tripple equal to ===, not equal to equal to !==

                            let a =5;
                            let b ="5";
                                console.log(a == b);   //ture, value will check
                                console.log(a != b);   //false,  value will check
                                console.log(a === b);   //false,  data type will check
                                console.log(a != b);   //true,  data type will check
                                

   5.Assignment Operators - assign = , add and assign +=, sub and assign -=, multiply and assign *=, 
                            division and assign /=,modulus and assign %=, expenential and assign **=
   6.Increment/Decrement -  ++ increment , -- decrement 
   7.Ternary operator -    condition ? exp 1 (if true) : exp 2 (if false)
                            e.g cosole.log(age<18 ? "not drive" : "drive");




comments in js -> Comments are used keep the notes in js which is ignored while runnnig/compilation of the
                  programm.

            There are two types of comments in js
            1.single line comment-  //

            2.multi-line commnet-  /*

                                    */
